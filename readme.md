## Introduction

Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Understanding the inner workings of these algorithms is crucial for becoming proficient in machine learning. This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python.

## Algorithms Implemented

- [x] Linear Regression  (will be implemented)
- [x] Logistic Regression (will be implemented)
- [x] K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (will be implemented)
- [x] Decision Tree (will be implemented)
- [x] Random Forest (will be implemented)
- [x] Support Vector Machine (SVM) (will be implemented)
- [x] K-Means Clustering (will be implemented)
- [x] Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (will be implemented)
- [x] Neural Networks  (will be implemented)
- [ ] (More algorithms will be added...)

## Installation

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML-Algorithms-From-Scratch.git
cd ML-Algorithms-From-Scratch
```
Create and activate a conda environment:

```bash
 conda env create -f environment.yml
 conda activate ml-projects
```

ML-Algorithms-From-Scratch

Use each project using the installation guide provided in the project's folder.

## Usage

Each algorithm has its own dedicated folder containing the implementation and a Jupyter notebook with examples of how to use it. To run the notebooks, you need to have Jupyter installed:

pip install jupyter
jupyter notebook

Open the notebook you are interested in and run the cells to see the algorithm in action.
