## Introduction

Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Understanding the inner workings of these algorithms is crucial for becoming proficient in machine learning. This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python.

## Algorithms Implemented

- [x] Linear Regression
- [x] Logistic Regression 
- [x] K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- [x] Naive Bayes Classifier
- [x] Decision Tree
- [x] Random Forest
- [x] Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- [x] K-Means Clustering 
- [x] Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
- [ ] Neural Networks  (will be implemented)
- [ ] (More algorithms will be added...)

## Installation

Use the Installation guide provided in the each project. 

ML-Algorithms-From-Scratch

Use each project using the installation guide provided in the project's folder.

## Usage

Each algorithm has its own dedicated folder containing the implementation and a Jupyter notebook with examples of how to use it. To run the notebooks, you need to have Jupyter installed:

pip install jupyter
jupyter notebook

Open the notebook you are interested in and run the cells to see the algorithm in action.
